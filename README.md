# LEARNING: Networking

This repository contains the text and code I learnt and written during my study of the book: [Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (6th Ed) by Kurose](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Networking-Top-Down-Approach-6th/dp/0132856204)

The learning concentrated around network protocols (especially TCP/IP aka internet protocol suite) rather than physical architecture.
