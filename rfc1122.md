# Requirements for internet hosts - Communication layers

This is one RFC of a pair that defines and discusses the requirements for internet host software. This RFC covers the communications protocol layers: link layer, IP layer, and transport layer; its companion RFC-1123 covers the application and support protocols

## Introduction

This document is one of a pair that defines and discusses the requirements for host system implementations of the internet protocol suite. This RFC covers the communications protocol layers: link layer, IP layer, and transport layer. Its companion RFC, "Requirements for internet hosts - Application and support", covers the application layer protocols. This document should also be read in conjunction with "Requirements for internet gateways".

These documents are intended to provide guidance for vendors, implementors, and users of the internet communication softwares. They represent the consensus of a large body of technical experience and wisdom, contributed by the members of the internet research and vendor communities.

This RFC enumerates standard protocols that a host connected to the internet must use, and it incorporates by reference the RFCs and other documents describing the current specifications for these protocols. Its correct errors in the referenced documents and adds additional discussion and guidance for an implementor.

For each protocol, this document also contains an explicit set of requirements, recommendations, and options. The reader must understand that the list of requirements in this document is incomplete by itself; the complete set of requirements for an internet host is primarily defined in the standard protocol specification documentations, with the corrections, ammendments, and supplements contained in this RFC.

A good-faith implementation of the protocols that was produced after careful reading of the RFCs with some interaction with the internet technical community, and that followed good communications software engineering practices, should differ from the requirements of this document in only minor ways. Thus, in many cases, the "requirements" in this RFC are already stated or implied in the standard protocol documents, so that their inclusion here is, in a sense, redundant. However, they were included because some past implementation has made the wrong choice, causing problems of interoperability, performance, and/or robustness.

This document includes discussions and explanations of many of the requirements and recommendations. A simple list of requirements would be dangerous, because:

- Some required features are more important than others, and some features are optional.

- There may be valid reasons why particular vendor products that are designed for restricted contexts might choose to use different specifications.

However, the specifications of this document must be followed to meet the general goal of arbitrary host interoperation across the diversity and complexity of the internet systems. Although most current implementations fail to meet these requirements in various ways, some minor and some major, this specification is the ideal towards which we need to move.

These requirements are based on the current level of internet architecture. This document will be updated as required to provide additional clarifications or to include additional information in those areas in which specifications are still evolving.

This introductory section begins with a brief overview of the internet architecture as it relates to hosts, and then gives some general advice to host software vendors. Finally, there is guidance on reading the rest of the documents and some terminology.

### The internet architecture

General background and discussion on the internet architecture and supporting protocol suite can be found in the DDN protocol handbook.

#### Internet hosts

A host computer, or simply "host", is the ultimate consumer of communication services. A host generally executes an application program on behalf of user(s), employing network and/or internet communication services in support of this function. An internet host corresponds to the concept of "end-system" used in the OSI protocol suite.

An internet communication system consists of interconnected packet networks supporting communication among host computers using the interent protocols. The networks are interconnected using packet-switching computers called "gateways" or "IP routers" by the internet community, and "intermediate systems" by the OSI world. The RFC "Requirements for internet gateways" contains the official specifications for internet gateways. That RFC together with the present document and its companion define the rules for the current realization of the internet architecture.

The internet hosts span a wide range of size, speed, and function. They range in size from small microprocessors through workstations to mainframes and supercomputers. In function, they range from single-purpose hosts (such as terminal servers) to full-service hosts that support a variety of online network services, typically including remote login, file transfer, and electronic mail.

A host is generally said to be multihomed if it has more than one interface to the same or to different networks.

#### Architectural assumptions

The current internet architecture is based on a set of assumptions about the communication system. The assumptions most relevant to hosts are as follows:

- The internet is a network of networks

Each host is directly connected to some particular network(s); its connection to the internet is only conceptual. Two hosts on the same network communicate with each other using the same set of protocols that they would use to communicate with hosts on distant networks.

- Gateways do not keept connection state information

To improve robustness of the communication system, gateways are designed to be stateless, forwarding each IP datagram independently of other datagrams. As a result, redundant paths can be exploited to provide robust service in spite of failures of intervening gateways and networks.

All state information required for end-to-end flow control and reliability is implemented in the hosts, in the transport layer or in application programs. All connection control information is thus co-located with the end points of the communication, so it will be lost only if an end point fails.

- Routing complexity should be in the gateways

Routing is a complex and difficult problem, and ought to be performed by the gateways, not the hosts. An important objective is to insulate host software from changes caused by the inevitable evolution of the internet routing architecture.

- The system must tolerate wide network variation

A basic objective of the internet design is to tolerate a wide range of network characteristics - e.g., bandwidth, delay, packet loss, packet reordering, and maximum packet size. Another objective is robustness against failure of individual networks, gateways, and hosts, using whatever bandwidth is still available. Finally, the goal is full "open system interconnection": an internet host must be able to interoperate robustly and effectively with any other internet host, across diverse internet paths.

Sometimes host implementors have designed for less ambitious goals. For example, the LAN environment is typically much more benign than the internet as a whole; LANs have low packet loss and delay and do not reorder packets. Some vendors have fielded host implementations that are adequate for a simple LAN environment, but work badly for general interoperation. The vendor justifies such a product as being economical within the restricted LAN market. However, isolated LANs seldom stay isolated for long; they are soon gatewayed to each other, to organization-wide internets, and eventually to the global internet system. In the end, neither the customer nor the vendor is served by incomplete or substandard internet host software.

The requirements spelled out in this document are designed for a full-function interent hosts, capable of full interoperation over an arbitrary internet path.

#### Internet protocol suite

To communicate using the internet system, a host must implement the layered set of protocols comprising the internet protocol suite. A host typically must implement at least one protocol from each layer.

The protocol layers in the internet architecture are as follows:

1. Application layer

The application layer is the top layer of the internet protocol suite. The internet suite does not further subdivide the application layer, although some of the internet application layer protocols do contain some internal sub-layering. The application layer of the internet suite essentially combines the functions of the top two layers - Presentation and Application - of the OSI reference model.

We distinguish two categories of application layer protocols: user protocols that provide service directly to users, and support protocols that provide common system functions. Requirements for user and support protocols will be found in the companion RFC.

The most common internet user protocols are:

- Telnet (remote login)
- FTP (file transfer)
- SMTP (electronic mail delivery)

There are a number of other standardized user protocols and many private user protocols.

Support protocols, used for host name mapping, booting, and management, include SNMP, BOOTP, RARP, and the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols.

2. Transport layer

The transport layer provides end-to-end communication services for applications. There are two primary transport layer protocols at present:

- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
- User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

TCP is a reliable connection-oriented transport service that provides end-to-end reliability, resequencing, and flow control. UDP is a connectionless ("datagram") transport service.

Other transport protocols have been developed by the research community, and the set of official internet transport protocols may be expanded in the future. Transport layer protocols are discussed in Chapter 4.

3. Internet later

All interent transport protocols use the Internet Protocol (IP) to carry data from source host to destination host. IP is a connectionless or datagram internetwork service, providing no end-to-end delivery guarantees. Thus, IP datagrams may arrive at the destination host damaged, duplicated, out of order, or not at all. The layers above IP are responsible for reliable delivery service when it is required. The IP protocol includes provision for addressing, type-of-service specifications, fragmentation and reassembly, and security information.

The datagram or connectionless nature of the IP protocol is a fundamental and characteristic feature of the internet architecture. Internet IP was the model for the OSI Connectionless Network Protocol.

ICMP is a control protocol that is considered to be an integral part of IP, although it is architecturally layered upon IP, i.e., it uses IP to carry its data end-to-end just as a transport protocol like TCP or UDP does. ICMP provides error reporting, congestion reporting, and first-hop gateway redirection.

IGMP is an internet layer protocol used for establishing dynamic host groups for IP multicasting. The internet layer protocols IP, ICMP, and IGMP, are discussed in Chapter 3.

4. Link layer

To communicate on its directly-connected networks, a host must implement the communication protocol used to interface to that network. We call this a link layer or media-access layer protocol.

There is a wide variety of link layer protocols, corresponding to the many different types of networks.

#### Embedded gateway code

Some internet host software includes embedded gateway functionality, so that these hosts can forward packets as a gateway would, while still performing the application layer functions of a host.

Such dual-purpose systems must follow the Gateway Requirements RFC with respect to thier gateway functions, and must follow the present document with respect to their host functions. In all overlapping cases, the two specifications should be in agreement.

There are varying opinions in the internet community about embedded gateway functionality. The main arguments are as follows:

- Pro: in a local network environment where networking is informal, or in isolated interents, it may be convenient and economical to use existing host systems as gateways.

There is also an architectural argument for embedded gateway functionality: multihoming is much more common than originally foreseen, and multihoming forces a host to make routing decisions as if it were a gateway. If the multihomed host contains an embedded gateway, it will have full routing knowledge and as a result will be able to make more optimal routing decision
